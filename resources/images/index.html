            Stranger <strong>HEY</strong>things
We're like, like we're stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
'Cause that's just who we are
We'd used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know<br>
I remember
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh<br>

            I don't know how they treat you
How they do it where you at
But all I'm tryna say is
You should know me like that
I'm just<em> HEY </em> sayin' (It's the R and B Killah)
I'm just sayin' (you should know me like that)
(It's the R&B Killah)
Your man said get my money up
Get my money up
So I went and got my money up
And now I got this money up
I'm wit' a H.A.W.A. - Ah, Ah<br>
Dream dropped <u> HEY </u>another one
Tell dem niggas bye-bye
I got girls in da club 
Girls in the church
Pull 'em all day
I take 'em off work
Got girls in the draft 
Girls on my label
Girls at the bank
'Cause I'm about my paper
Got girls with weave
Girls without it
She like, "This all mine."
"Hmmm, I doubt it."
Girls in New York
Girls in L.A. <br>
